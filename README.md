# The idea behind this website

A friend of mine had an issue that I decided to help with a simple website.

The story is as follows: My friend and his partners have a local folk band and they get together quite often to play songs with other musicians and people in general. It is quite common in the countryside of Argentina, that the people meet and sing together with the band. Furthermore, if you come with your guitar, you can also join and show your skills as a musician. But there is a little problem, this songs are most of the times famous in the province, but completely unknown for other places in the country. 
Another common thing in this side of the earth: tradition dictates that musicians lean how to play this old folk songs with a book of chords. A book that goes hand by hand every time that there is a "tocada" (playing meeting). 
This generates an issue, there are a couple of books and not everyone can see the chords when you want to join to play, and also, you should follow the tone, otherwise is a mess.
Long story short: they need a tool to see these very old chords whenever they meet, easy to acces and fully responsive of course. So, I will digitalize their chords and display them in this website, alongside with lyrics and local musicians stories and pictures.
